In the Migration Assessment Application, the page now displays information about the Integration Directory and, optionally, the Enterprise Services Repository you connected to your previously created system.

4. In the Migration Assessment Application, navigate to Configure > Rules.
   <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/Configure_Rule.png)
Here you can find a list of rules predefined by SAP. Rules are a set of characteristics according to which the application evaluates whether an integration scenario can be migrated and what effort you can expect.

Note: Currently, you canâ€™t add custom rules or edit the standard rules. You can only view the standard rules.

5. As an example, select the rule SenderAdapterType

Here, you can see all the parameters of the rules, such as Rule Match Value, Assessment Category, and the Weight assigned to each rule match value. Based on these weights, the application calculates the estimated effort, which means that some parameters, and therefore rules, have a bigger influence on the final estimation than others.
